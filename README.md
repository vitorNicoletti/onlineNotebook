# ðŸ“’ onlineNotebook  

**An application that allows users to save and access their notebook anywhere.**

## ðŸ›  About the Project  
This is my first personal project using **Node.js** with **Express**. I'm using this project to sharpen my skills with these tools.  
The application provides a simple API to manage user accounts and their notebooks stored in a non-relational database.  

ðŸ’¡ My plan is to:
- Develop the **front-end** using **Angular** (which, at the moment, I don't know anything about, haha)  
- Create a **full-stack application** combining the back-end and front-end  

For now, here's what I've accomplished:  
- [x] Basic notebook API functionality (Create, Read, Update notebooks)  
- [x] Authentication using JWT (currently, tokens donâ€™t expire)  
- [ ] Implement the `DeletePages` function (not implemented yet)
